## Macintosh Twin
White noise can get a little boring, and music can be a little distracting. Why seek out the perfect focus-enhancing soundscape when a computer can generate it for you? 

Macintosh Twin is a vaporwave/aphex twin/soundscape inspired mix of rhythm, soundscapes, and melody. It evolves into something new every time. It is generated (all client side) from a mix of music theory, randomness, and a little inspiration from @officialjaden.
